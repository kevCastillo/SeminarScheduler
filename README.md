# Seminar Schedule Organizer - Implementation Guide

This document provides instructions for implementing a mockup of the Seminar Schedule Organizer web application using ASP.NET Core MVC. The mockup is designed to be completed in approximately one day and serve as a presentation-ready prototype for a client meeting.

## Project Overview

The Seminar Schedule Organizer is a web-based application designed to:
- Streamline first-year seminar scheduling
- Automatically detect and prevent course conflicts
- Optimize faculty workload distribution
- Provide real-time analytics on scheduling

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Project Setup
1. Create a new ASP.NET Core MVC project with Individual User Authentication
2. Set up the Entity Framework database context
3. Configure user authentication options for simplified development

### Step 2: Models and Database
1. Create the basic models:
   - Seminar
   - Faculty
   - Department
   - ConflictRecord (for tracking scheduling conflicts)
2. Apply Entity Framework migrations to create the database schema

### Step 3: User Interface
1. Customize the layout with proper navigation and branding
2. Implement the login and registration pages
3. Create the dashboard with summary statistics and activity feed
4. Develop the calendar view with FullCalendar.js integration
5. Add filtering options and legends for the calendar

### Step 4: Controllers and Logic
1. Implement the `DashboardController` with actions for different views
2. Add basic CRUD operations for managing seminars
3. Implement a simple conflict detection mechanism
4. Create sample data for demonstration purposes

### Step 5: Styling and Finishing Touches
1. Apply custom CSS to create a professional appearance
2. Ensure responsive design for different screen sizes
3. Add appropriate icons and visual elements
4. Test all functionality and fix any issues
5. Prepare demonstration notes for client meeting

## Next Steps After Mockup

This mockup is intended as a starting point for discussion. After client feedback, these would be the next development phases:

1. **Core Functionality Implementation**
   - Complete database design and relationships
   - Implement full scheduling algorithm
   - Develop conflict resolution system

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Reporting and analytics dashboard
   - Integration with existing university systems
   - Email notifications for schedule changes and conflicts

3. **Testing and Deployment**
   - Comprehensive testing with real data
   - Security audit and optimization
   - Production deployment setup

## Technologies Used

- ASP.NET Core MVC
- Entity Framework Core
- Identity Framework for authentication
- Bootstrap for responsive design
- FullCalendar.js for calendar visualization
- SQL Server for data storage
